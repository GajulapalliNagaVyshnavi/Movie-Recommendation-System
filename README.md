# AI-Movie-Recommendation-System


This project aims to implement a movie recommendation system using
collaborative filtering in python and perform exploratory data analysis on the
datasets used. In order to gain valuable insights to make recommendations for
users based on ratings of other users who have watched movies with similar
ratings to recommend further movies to watch data frames, collaborative
filtering techniques will be applied.
This will be done by working and pre-processing a dataset of user-movie
ratings which will be stored in a data frame. The data frame is useful in order
to manipulate, filter, sort the data by user movie id or ratings which will then
be visualized by visualization libraries like seaborn in order to provide useful
insights into the similarities and outliers in the data
